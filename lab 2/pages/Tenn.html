<h1>Tinn</h1>
	<p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p>
<p>
	Tinwares were being produced in London by the 1630s, being known as Crooked Lane Wares (from the street where they were made).<br> The Worshipful Company of Tin Plate Workers were incorporated as a separate London Livery Company.<br>The tinsmith has been plying his trade in America since 1720. Colonial tinsmiths used tinplate, wire, solder, and a few simple tools to produce their wares.<br>When tinplate was finally produced in America in the early 19th century the products of the tinsmith became more widely available.
