	<p><strong>GOLD</strong></p>
	<p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p>
	<p>
	  Gold has been worked by humans in all cultures where the metal is available, either indigenously or imported, and the history of these activities is extensive.<br> Superbly made objects from the ancient cultures of Africa, Asia, Europe, India, North America, Mesoamerica, and South America grace museums and collections throughout the world.<br> Some pieces date back thousands of years and were made using many techniques that still are used by modern goldsmiths.
	  A goldsmith might have a wide array of skills and knowledge at their disposal. Gold, being the most malleable metal of all, offers unique opportunities for the worker.
	  In today's world a wide variety of other metals, especially platinum alloys, also may be used frequently. 24 Carat is pure gold and historically, was known as fine gold.
	  Because it is so soft, however, 24 Carat gold is rarely used. It usually is alloyed to make it stronger and to create different colors; goldsmiths may have some skill in that process. <br>The gold may be cast into some item then, usually with the lost wax casting process, or it may be used to fabricate the work directly in metal.

	<p><strong>SILVER</strong></p>
	<p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p>
	<p>
	   Household silver or silverware (the silver, the plate, or silver service) includes tableware, cutlery and other household items made of sterling silver, Britannia silver or Sheffield plate silver.<br> Silver is sometimes bought in sets or combined to form sets, such as a set of silver candlesticks or a silver tea set.>
	   Historically, silverware was divided into table silver, for eating, and dressing silver for bedrooms and dressing rooms.<br> The grandest form of the latter was the toilet service, typically of 10-30 pieces, often silver-gilt, which was especially a feature of the period from 1650 to about 1780.
	   Silver requires a good deal of care, as it tarnishes and must be hand polished, since careless or machine polishing ruins the patina and can completely erode the silver layer in Sheffield plate.

	<h1>Tinn</h1>
	<p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p>
<p>
	Tinwares were being produced in London by the 1630s, being known as Crooked Lane Wares (from the street where they were made).<br> The Worshipful Company of Tin Plate Workers were incorporated as a separate London Livery Company.<br>The tinsmith has been plying his trade in America since 1720. Colonial tinsmiths used tinplate, wire, solder, and a few simple tools to produce their wares.<br>When tinplate was finally produced in America in the early 19th century the products of the tinsmith became more widely available.
