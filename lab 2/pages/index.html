	  <p><strong>GOLD</strong></p>
	  <p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p>
	<p>Gold has been worked by humans in all cultures where the metal is available, either indigenously or imported, and the history of these activities is extensive.<br> Superbly made objects from the ancient cultures of Africa, Asia, Europe, India, North America, Mesoamerica, and South America grace museums and collections throughout the world.<br> Some pieces date back thousands of years and were made using many techniques that still are used by modern goldsmiths.</p>
	<p>A goldsmith might have a wide array of skills and knowledge at their disposal. Gold, being the most malleable metal of all, offers unique opportunities for the worker.</p>
	<p>In today's world a wide variety of other metals, especially platinum alloys, also may be used frequently. 24 Carat is pure gold and historically, was known as fine gold.</p>
	<p>Because it is so soft, however, 24 Carat gold is rarely used. It usually is alloyed to make it stronger and to create different colors; goldsmiths may have some skill in that process. <br>The gold may be cast into some item then, usually with the lost wax casting process, or it may be used to fabricate the work directly in metal.</p>

	<p><strong>SILVER</strong></p>
	<p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p>
	<p>Household silver or silverware (the silver, the plate, or silver service) includes tableware, cutlery and other household items made of sterling silver, Britannia silver or Sheffield plate silver.<br> Silver is sometimes bought in sets or combined to form sets, such as a set of silver candlesticks or a silver tea set.</p>
	<p>Historically, silverware was divided into table silver, for eating, and dressing silver for bedrooms and dressing rooms.<br> The grandest form of the latter was the toilet service, typically of 10-30 pieces, often silver-gilt, which was especially a feature of the period from 1650 to about 1780.</p>
	<p>Silver requires a good deal of care, as it tarnishes and must be hand polished, since careless or machine polishing ruins the patina and can completely erode the silver layer in Sheffield plate.</p>
