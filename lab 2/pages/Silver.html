	<h1>Silver</h1>
	<p><strong>HISTORY</strong></p>
<p>
	Household silver or silverware (the silver, the plate, or silver service) includes tableware, cutlery and other household items made of sterling silver, Britannia silver or Sheffield plate silver.<br> Silver is sometimes bought in sets or combined to form sets, such as a set of silver candlesticks or a silver tea set.
	Historically, silverware was divided into table silver, for eating, and dressing silver for bedrooms and dressing rooms.<br> The grandest form of the latter was the toilet service, typically of 10-30 pieces, often silver-gilt, which was especially a feature of the period from 1650 to about 1780.
	Silver requires a good deal of care, as it tarnishes and must be hand polished, since careless or machine polishing ruins the patina and can completely erode the silver layer in Sheffield plate.
