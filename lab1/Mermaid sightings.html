	<p><i>The story is more complicated and much older than what Hollywood movies shows.</i></p>
	<h2><strong>The Deerness mermaid</strong></h2>
	<p>One of the oldest and most famous of the mermaid sightings in Orkney took place over a few summers around 1890.<br>At this time there were a series of sightings of a "creature" that came to be known as "the Deerness Mermaid".</p>
	<p>A regular visitor to Newark Bay, in Deerness, the mermaid went on to achieve considerable fame,<br> with hundreds of eyewitnesses swearing to the validity of their encounters.</p>
	<p>From documented reports, it appears the mermaid stayed some distance from the shore, so exact details are vague.<br>

But one account does provide a good description of a sighting and, as you will see,<br> it was a far cry from the archetypal storybook mermaid:

"It is about six to seven feet in length, has a little black head, with neck, <br>a snow white body and two arms, and in swimming it just appears like a human being.<br> At times it will appear to be siding on a sunken rock, and will wave and work its hands."</p>
<h3><strong>The Hoy sea woman</strong></h3>
<p>Another mermaid encounter was reported in 1913, and detailed multiple sightings of a "mermaid" in the deep waters off the south-eastern coast of Hoy.</p>
<p>Ralph Taylor and crew, when visiting their lobster creels the other day, saw a strange creature, which looked like a mermaid, close by the foot of the Old Man.</p>
<p>It rose out of the water to the height of three feet and looked like a lady with a shawl round her shoulders, and streaming down her face.</p>
<p>This is the third occasion it has been seen at close range by them. The oldest people have never seen anything like it before,<br> and wonder what it can be. Some think it must be the Deerness Mermaid on tour.</p>

<p>This is only few of the thousands of mermaid sightings stories some of them confirms the idea of a beautiful and peaceful creature<br> while others tells about a scary and dangerous creature,<br> It is hard to tell what is true and what is fake in this matter.</p>
