	<h1>Stearic acid</h1>
	<p>Stearic acid (stair-ik or steer-ik) is a saturated fatty acid with an 18-carbon chain and has the IUPAC name octadecanoic acid.</p>
	<p> It is a waxy solid and its chemical formula is C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H.</p>
	<p>The salts and esters of stearic acid are called stearates.<br> As its ester, stearic acid is one of the most common saturated fatty acids found in nature following palmitic acid.<br> The triglyceride derived from three molecules of stearic acid is called stearin.</p>

	<p>In general, the applications of stearic acid exploit its bifunctional character, with a polar head group that can be attached to metal cations and a nonpolar chain that confers solubility in organic solvents. <br>The combination leads to uses as a surfactant and softening agent. <br>Stearic acid undergoes the typical reactions of saturated carboxylic acids, a notable one being reduction to stearyl alcohol, and esterification with a range of alcohols. <br>This is used in a large range of manufactures, from simple to complex electronic devices.</p>
	<h2><strong>Stearyl alcohol</strong></h2>
	<p>Stearyl alcohol (also known as octadecyl alcohol or 1-octadecanol) is an organic compound with the formula CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>16</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH.</p>
	<p>It is classified as a fatty alcohol. It takes the form of white granules or flakes, which are insoluble in water.</p>
	<p>It has a wide range of uses as an ingredient in lubricants, resins, perfumes and cosmetics.<br>It is used as an emollient, emulsifier, and thickener in ointments of various sorts, and is widely used as a hair coating in shampoos and hair conditioners.<br>It has also found application as an evaporation suppressing monolayer when applied to the surface of water.<br>Stearyl alcohol is prepared from stearic acid or some fats by the process of catalytic hydrogenation. It has low toxicity.</p>

	<h3><strong>Sodium stearate</strong></h3>
	<p>Sodium stearate C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>35</sub>NaO<sub>2</sub>  is the sodium salt of stearic acid.</p>
	<p>This white solid is the most common soap. It is found in many types of solid deodorants, rubbers, latex paints, and inks. It is also a component of some food additives and food flavorings.</p>
