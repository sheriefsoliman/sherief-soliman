	<h1>A summer day with <i>JAWS</i></h1>
	<p>Last summer i decided that i will walk everyday to lose weight<br>and i managed to lose 20kgs in two months.</p>
	<p>This achievement would not have happened if it wasnt for my best friend <i>JAWS.</i></p>
	<h2><em>JAWS</em></h2>
	<p>Jaws is a White English Bulldog, he is now 4 years old and i had him since he was 6 months old,<br>for over three years he was my best friend and my loyal companion.</p>
